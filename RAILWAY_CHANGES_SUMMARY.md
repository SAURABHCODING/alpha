# Railway Deployment Modifications Summary

This document summarizes all the changes made to make the Judge0 application compatible with Railway deployment.

## Files Added

### 1. `Procfile`
- Defines web and worker processes for Railway
- Web process runs the Rails server
- Worker process runs Resque background jobs

### 2. `railway.toml`
- Railway-specific project configuration
- Sets up build and deployment parameters
- Configures restart policies

### 3. `nixpacks.toml`
- Build configuration for Nixpacks (Railway's build system)
- Specifies build commands and environment variables
- Optimizes for production deployment

### 4. `.env.railway`
- Example environment variables for Railway deployment
- Contains recommended settings for production
- Template for configuring your Railway environment

### 5. `RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT.md`
- Comprehensive deployment guide
- Step-by-step instructions for Railway deployment
- Troubleshooting tips and best practices

### 6. `prepare_railway.sh`
- Automation script to prepare the application
- Verifies all necessary files are present
- Provides next steps for deployment

## Files Modified

### 1. `config/database.yml`
**Changes:**
- Updated to primarily use `DATABASE_URL` (Railway standard)
- Added fallback to individual environment variables
- Simplified pool configuration
- Made more flexible for different environments

### 2. `config/puma.rb`
**Changes:**
- Added fallback values for environment variables
- Improved Railway compatibility
- Added conditional worker configuration
- Enhanced production settings with preloading

### 3. `Gemfile`
**Changes:**
- Added Ruby version specification (3.2.0)
- Reorganized gems into proper groups
- Added bootsnap for faster boot times
- Added production gem group for future enhancements

## Key Railway Compatibility Features

### Environment Variables
- **DATABASE_URL**: Automatically provided by Railway PostgreSQL
- **REDIS_URL**: Automatically provided by Railway Redis
- **PORT**: Automatically assigned by Railway
- **RAILS_ENV**: Set to production for deployment

### Process Management
- **Web Process**: Rails server bound to Railway's assigned port
- **Worker Process**: Resque workers for background job processing
- **Scaling**: Both processes can be scaled independently in Railway

### Build Optimization
- **Nixpacks Integration**: Optimized build process for Ruby/Rails
- **Bundle Configuration**: Excludes development/test gems in production
- **Asset Pipeline**: Configured for Railway's static file serving

### Database Configuration
- **Flexible Connection**: Supports both URL and individual parameters
- **Connection Pooling**: Optimized for Railway's infrastructure
- **Migration Ready**: Prepared for Railway's database migration workflow

## Deployment Workflow

1. **Repository Setup**: Push code to GitHub with all Railway files
2. **Railway Project**: Create new project connected to GitHub repo
3. **Add Services**: PostgreSQL and Redis databases
4. **Environment Config**: Set required environment variables
5. **Deploy**: Railway automatically builds and deploys
6. **Scale**: Adjust web and worker processes as needed

## Benefits of These Changes

### Reliability
- Improved error handling and fallback configurations
- Better process management for production workloads
- Enhanced logging and monitoring capabilities

### Performance
- Optimized build process with Nixpacks
- Efficient gem bundling for production
- Proper connection pooling and threading

### Maintainability
- Clear separation of development and production configs
- Comprehensive documentation and guides
- Automated preparation scripts

### Scalability
- Independent scaling of web and worker processes
- Railway's auto-scaling capabilities
- Efficient resource utilization

## Next Steps

1. **Review Configuration**: Check `.env.railway` for your specific needs
2. **Update Secrets**: Generate and set `SECRET_KEY_BASE`
3. **Test Locally**: Verify changes work in development
4. **Deploy**: Follow the Railway deployment guide
5. **Monitor**: Use Railway's monitoring tools post-deployment

## Rollback Information

If you need to revert changes:
- Original files are backed up in `.railway_backup/` (when using prepare script)
- Git history contains all original configurations
- Each modified file has clear before/after documentation
